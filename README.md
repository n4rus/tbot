#About

Tbot is a program that gets data from an api(novadax by default), makes it into dataframes, and 
gives output in xlsx at the end. In later versions it may handle trades in loops. 
The same algoritm may work to S&P 500 as well, so under few mods it can be adjusted again into it. 
For information on license acess 'gpl-3.0' or for detailed info 'README.md'.
